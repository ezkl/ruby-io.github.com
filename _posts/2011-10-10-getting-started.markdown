Just working on getting this articles section set up.

If you're interested in submitting an article, please, do! Since we're using [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) the process is pretty straightforward, but for some more details, check out the Rubinius document on [How to write a blog post](http://rubini.us/doc/en/how-to/write-a-blog-post/) as it's the same for us. Instructions will be written on how to write articles & submit pull requests soon.
