[Evan Phoenix](https://twitter.com/evanphx), creator of [Rubinius](http://rubini.us) and all-around great guy, just wrote a post entitled [Ruby, Concurrency, and You](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/ruby-concurrency-and-you/) over at the Engine Yard Blog. He explains the difference between concurrency &amp; parallelism and briefly describes how each Ruby implementation handles those ideas.
