        We all know Ruby can "scale" and that it's usually Fast Enough&trade; but it doesn't have the best reputation 
        with regards to high throughput or high performance computing. Is this true?
      </p>

      <h2>No.</h2>

      <p>
        This site is here for the Ruby community to document &amp; share ideas around better ways to write <em>and</em> 
        implement Ruby so the statement above will one day be something we can all look back at and laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sections in the header are just ideas right now. This is a new project, and it is meant to be tailored 
        to what the community wants. Please submit <a href="https://github.com/ruby-io/ruby-io.github.com/issues">issues</a> or 
        <a href="https://github.com/ruby-io/ruby-io.github.com">fork</a> away &amp; add content. All help is appreciated!
